#### Riddler Solution for September 9<sup>th</sup>, 2016

[Original Problem Statement:](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-keeps-the-money-you-found-on-the-floor/)

*You and four statistician colleagues find a $100 bill on the floor of your departmentâ€™s faculty lounge. None of you have change, so you agree to play a game of chance to divide the money probabilistically. The five of you sit around a table. The game is played in turns. Each turn, one of three things can happen, each with an equal probability: The bill can move one position to the left, one position to the right, or the game ends and the person with the bill in front of him or her wins the game. You have tenure and seniority, so the bill starts in front of you. What are the chances you win the money?*

*Extra credit: What if there were N statisticians in the department?*

#### My Solution (Elementary)

Believe it or not, starting at $N=\infty$ is easiest. Imagine there are an infinite number of statisticians to your right and left (scary). For finite $N$, just consider each index modulo $N$ as the same person. We'll call $\frac{1}{3}$ the attenuating factor $f$ and restate the problem such: At each step, there is an $f$ chance of stopping the game, and if the game keeps going, an equal chance of the bill proceeding to the left or right. We have an attenuated random walk, basically a game of coin tosses in which an ump decides with probability $f$ whether to call the game before the next toss. The question is, where is the bill when he does? If I'm at index $0$, I'm asking what are the odds the number of heads and tails are equal? If I'm at index $i$ I'm asking what are the odds that $i$ is the difference between the number of heads and tails tossed?

The answer is, for $n$ coin tosses, there are $\binom{n}{k}$ combinations where #heads - #tails = $k$, a probability of $\binom{n}{k}$ in $2^n$ provided $n$ has the same parity as $i$, else zero. The chances of the game ending at step $n$ is $f(1-f)^{n-1}$. Putting it all together:
$$
P_0 = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{f(1-f)^{2k}}{2^{2k}}\binom{2k}{k}, P_0(f=\frac{1}{3}) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{3^{2k+1}}\binom{2k}{k} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \approx 0.4472136
$$

We can modify the equation above to include $i$, but no need. By symmetry, we know that the professors to your right and left have the same chance of winning the bill as you, multiplied by some dampener, $r$; the professors two steps to your right and left, $r^2$. Sum this distribution to $1$ and you get:
$$
... + \frac{r^2}{\sqrt{5}} + \frac{r}{\sqrt{5}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} + \frac{r}{\sqrt{5}} + \frac{r^2}{\sqrt{5}} + ...
$$

Solving for $r$ we get $r = \frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 0.381966$ . Incidentally, $r = 1-\frac{1}{\phi}$ for $\phi$ the golden ratio, which will come into play shortly.

So in the infinite game, your chances, if you are sitting $i$ steps away from the tenured professor, are $P_i = P_0r^i$, for $P_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}$ and $r = \frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2}$ . As percentages, it goes: $44.7\%, 17.1\%, 6.5\%, 2.5\%, ...$

Now since it's not physically possible to have an infinite number of statisticians (much to Hilbert's sorrow), for an arbitrary $N$ we can sum over these probabilities for a given remainder $s$:
$$
P_s = \sum_{i \equiv s (mod N)} P_0r^{|i|} = \sum_{i \equiv s (mod N)} \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}(\frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2})^{|i|} = \sum_{i=-\infty}^\infty P_0r^{|iN+s|}
$$

At first blush, the absolute value in the exponent may be disturbing, but it resolves itself beautifully. Consider $N=5, s=+2$:

$$
P_2 = ...+P_0r^{13}+P_0r^8+P_0r^3+P_0r^2+P_0r^7+P_0r^12+...
$$
$$
P_2 = P_0r^3(...+r^{10}+r^5+1)+P_0r^2(1+r^5+r^{10}+...) = P_0(r^3+r^2)(1+r^5+r^{10}+...) = \frac{P_0(r^3+r^2)}{1-r^5}
$$

In general, for $0 \le s \le N$,
$$
P_s = P_0\frac{(r^{N-s}+r^s)}{1-r^N}
$$

Rewriting for symmetry, substituting $p=\frac{N}{2}, q=\frac{N}{2}-s$,
$$
P_s = P_0\frac{(r^{p+q}+r^{p-q})}{1-r^{2p}} = P_0\frac{(r^{+q}+r^{-q})}{r^{-p}-r^{p}}
$$

Since $r=1-\frac{1}{\phi}$, it has some remarkable properties, and begging the reader's pardon for hand-waving the (very extensive) algebra, the following can be shown, for $L,F$ the Lucas and Fibonacci numbers:
$$
P_s =
  \begin{cases}
    N even\: L_{N-2s} / 5F_N \\
    N odd\: F_{N-2s} / L_N
  \end{cases}
$$

Enumerating the possible values of $N$ gives groups of professors the following odds, starting at seat $0$ through $N-1$:
$$
  \begin{cases}
    N = 1\: P = \{ \frac{1}{1} \} \\
    N = 2\: P = \{ \frac{3}{5}, \frac{2}{5} \} \\
    N = 3\: P = \{ \frac{2}{4}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{4} \} \\
    N = 4\: P = \{ \frac{7}{15}, \frac{3}{15}, \frac{2}{15}, \frac{3}{15} \} \\
    N = 5\: P = \{ \frac{5}{11}, \frac{2}{11}, \frac{1}{11}, \frac{1}{11}, \frac{2}{11} \} \\
    N = 6\: P = \{ \frac{18}{40}, \frac{7}{40}, \frac{3}{40}, \frac{2}{40}, \frac{3}{40}, \frac{7}{40} \}
  \end{cases}
$$
