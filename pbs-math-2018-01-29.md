#### Original problem inspired by [PBS Infinite Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxvZ6jwTuA)

*The regular pentagon and octagon both contain metallic ratios in their diagonals. The pentagon's 2nd (and therefore 3rd) diagonal's ratio to its side is $\phi$, the golden ratio. The octagon's 3rd (and therefore 5th) diagonal's ratio to its side is $\phi_2$, the silver ratio. Here we prove that no additional metallic ratios can exist in any regular polygon's third diagonal. This method could be extensible, but I have not been able to generalize it.*

First, notice that for $k=3$, we have solutions $(n,p)=(1,5),(2,8)$ for the statement "The ratio of a regular $p$-gon's $k$th diagonal to its side is $\phi_n$, the $n$th metallic ratio."

The goal is to solve the following formula with integers $k, n, p$. The lefthand side is the $n$th metallic ratio, $\phi_n$. The righthand side is the expression for the ratio of a regular $p$-gon's $k$th diagonal to its edge.

$\phi_n = \sqrt{\frac{1-cos(k\frac{2\pi}{p})}{1-cos(\frac{2\pi}{p})}}$

Setting $k=3$ and using cosine identities to pull the $3$ out of the cosine's argument, this simplifies to

$\phi_n = 2cos(\frac{2\pi}{p})+1$ [link](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sqrt((1-cos(3*2pi%2Fp))%2F((1-cos(2pi%2Fp)))))

So, for any $(n,p)$, does the righthand side satisfy the [metallic property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_mean) $\phi_n^2 = n\phi+1$?

$(2cos(\frac{2\pi}{p})+1)^2 = n(2cos(\frac{2\pi}{p})+1)+1$

Isolating $n$ the question becomes, for any value of $p$ does the righthand side of the below equation ever come out to a whole number?

$n = f(p) = \frac{(2cos(\frac{2\pi}{p})+1)^2-1}{2cos(\frac{2\pi}{p})+1}$

Well, yes. $f(5)=1, f(8)=2$, as expected. However, as $p$ grows, this expression asymptotically grows to $\frac{8}{3} \approx 2.6667$. Since it never reaches or exceeds $3$, these are all the possible solutions.

$\lim_{p \to \infty} \frac{(2cos(\frac{2\pi}{p})+1)^2-1}{2cos(\frac{2\pi}{p})+1} = \frac{8}{3}$ [link](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=lim+p-%3Einf+((2cos(2pi%2Fp)%2B1)%5E2-1)%2F(2cos(2pi%2Fp)%2B1))

#### Extensions

The choice of $k$ determines the cosine identity to be used. Specifically, which [Chebyshev Polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials) to use, $\cos(k\theta) = T_k(\cos(\theta))$. Above, we used $T_3(x) = 4x^3-3x$ which reduces nicely:

$\phi_n^2 = \frac{1-T_3(cos(\frac{2\pi}{p})}{1-cos(\frac{2\pi}{p})} = \frac{1-T_3(x)}{1-x} = \frac{1-4x^3+3x}{1-x} = (2x+1)^2$ [link](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(1-4x%5E3%2B3x)%2F(1-x))

While the higher polynomials do not reduce so nicely, perhaps running through the same math with each higher polynomial will reveal some exploitable pattern or process of induction to prove higher values of $k$, or extend this argument to infinity.
